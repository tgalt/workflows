What should I do next?

Need to make money right away.
Want it to be enjoyable for the long run.
Not having to be in a particular geography is ideal.
Working my own hours is ideal.
The ability to travel for business when I want it good.
Recurring revenue is ideal.
Can pivot if necesary but a full change means time wasted and money lost.

Make an app?
Hits all the buckets above except the ability to travel for business.

Write insurance
Hits most of the buckets but I would have to travel and work pretty normal hours.
