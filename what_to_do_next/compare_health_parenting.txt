I'm trying to decide which one of these apps I should build.  
  Both of them would have the same basic specs... built with FlutterFlow, pull data from OpenAI API, be deployed on Android, iOS and web.  
  They would be a subscription model with both of them being approximately the same cost to develop and the same cost per user on the app stores.
Here are the two ideas.
  An AI powered health app to design meal plans and workout plans.
  An AI powered app to provide biblicly based advice to parents on how to handle their current circumstances.
When taking into account the potential markets and how popular these types of apps could be, which app would potentially generate more revenue?

Each app has its unique advantages and challenges. 
  The health app caters to a broader market but faces intense competition, 
  while the parenting advice app targets a niche market with potentially less competition but a smaller user base. 
  Consider conducting more detailed market research and analysis to make an informed decision based on potential market size, 
  user acquisition costs, and long-term viability.
