What should I do next?

1 Need to make money right away.
2 Want it to be enjoyable for the long run.
3 Not having to be in a particular geography is ideal.
4 Working my own hours is ideal.
5 The ability to travel for business when I want it good.
6 Recurring revenue / passive(ish) income is ideal.

Can pivot if necesary but a full change means time wasted and money lost.

Make an app?
Hits all the buckets above except the ability to travel for business.
Maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
For sure 3, 6, 

Write insurance
Hits most of the buckets but I would have to travel and work pretty normal hours.
